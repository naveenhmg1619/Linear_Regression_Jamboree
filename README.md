## About
Jamboree Education has established itself as a leader in assisting students to secure places in top international colleges. Leveraging data-driven insights, they have introduced a feature that calculates the likelihood of acceptance into prestigious IVY league colleges, tailored for Indian applicants.

## Business Problem
The primary challenge lies in deciphering the intricate factors influencing graduate admissions and accurately forecasting admission probabilities for prospective students.

## Skills Used
- **Data Wrangling**: Implemented robust methods for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted hypothesis testing and ensured model assumptions were met.
- **Machine Learning**: Applied regression techniques to build predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using various statistical metrics.

## Objective
The goal is to construct a predictive Linear Regression model to estimate admission chances and to elucidate the significance and interrelations of various admission factors.

## Problems and Solutions
- **Data Consistency**: Addressed inconsistencies in column names by stripping trailing spaces.
- **Outlier Management**: Identified and rectified outliers in 'LOR' using the IQR method.
- **Feature Engineering**: Evaluated the importance of features using p-values and VIF, leading to the exclusion of 'SOP'.

## Machine Learning Model Details
- **Model Selection**: Linear Regression was selected for its transparency and ease of interpretation.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Explored Lasso and Ridge Regression to check for overfitting.
- **Model Diagnostics**: Performed residual analysis to validate model assumptions.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensured model robustness through cross-validation techniques.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Key Predictors**: GRE and TOEFL scores emerged as strong predictors, underscoring their role in admissions.
- **Feature Importance**: The analysis revealed that some features like University rating might not be as influential.
- **Model Optimization**: Suggested potential improvements through advanced feature engineering and optimization strategies.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided Jamboree Education with actionable insights into the factors affecting graduate admissions. The Linear Regression model serves as a reliable tool for predicting admission chances, with scope for further refinement.
